For those of you that already have a grab bag of maxscript extension dlx (like Larry's agni_dlx), I've attached source for a function that will launch a dos command in a hidden window. 

"HiddenDOSCommand" looks DOSCommand, but runs more like ShellLaunch. 
 
The calling syntax is:

HiddenDOSCommand <command string to execute> [startpath:unsupplied] [prompt:unsupplied] [donotwait:false]

"startpath" allows you to set the starting folder for the command.

"prompt" allows you to set the prompt that appears on the Max prompt line (just below the viewports). If you don't change it, the command string is displayed.

"donotwait" allows you to decide whether or not you want to return control to back to maxscript while the command runs, or wait for completion.

NOTE: You must redirect any output generated to a file if you are interested in text that would normally be printed to the console. 

Example usage:

HiddenDOSCommand "dir > %temp%\\hiddencmdout.tmp" startpath:"c:\\" 
cmd = "echo The time is " + localTime + " >> %temp%\\hiddencmdout.tmp"
HiddenDOSCommand cmd
HiddenDOSCommand "notepad %temp%\\hiddencmdout.tmp" prompt:"Waiting for Notepad to exit"
HiddenDOSCommand "del hiddencmd.tmp" startpath:"%temp%" donotwait:true
